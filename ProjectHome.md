tokyocabinet aims to be a complete python wrapper for the ass-kicking Tokyo Cabinet database library by Mikio Hirabayashi (http://1978th.net/). While there are other wrappers out there none were found to be comprehensive enough. At present, the btree, hash and table APIs are available as hand-written C extensions.
